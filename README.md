Project notebook contains following steps:
-Data cleaning and analysis to suit using with machine learning models.
-Data visualization to extract relationships between features and provide better understanding of data.
-Feature extracting and engineering.
-Training and evaluating machine learning models from sklearn library(RandomForest, SVM, K-Neighbors) on data then comparing their performance.
